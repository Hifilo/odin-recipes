    <h3>Nothing is more comforting than scalloped potatoes</h3>
    <h4>In this side dish, thinly sliced potatoes and onions are layered in an easy 
        homemade cream sauce and baked until tender, golden, and bubbly. 
        <em>Potato perfection!</em></h4>

        <p>Of all the potato side dishes from Oven Roasted Potatoes to Perfect Baked Potatoes, 
            nothing says comfort food like creamy side of scalloped potatoes (except maybe creamy buttery mashed potatoes).</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup butter</li>
         <li>1 large onion diced</li>
         <li>2 cloves garlic minced</li>
         <li>¼ cup flour</li>
         <li>2 cups milk</li>
         <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
         <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
         <li>¼ teaspoon pepper</li>
         <li>3 pounds white potatoes sliced about ⅛" thick</li>
         <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>Potatoes</h3>
            <p>Yukon gold potatoes (or red potatoes) have tender skin 
                and don’t require peeling (they hold their shape well).
                Russet potatoes or Idaho potatoes will work but tend to break apart more (but still taste good).</p></li>
        <li><h3>Onions</h3><p>Onions add a lot of flavor to this recipe and are a classic ingredient. Slice very thinly.</p></li>
        <li><h3>Cream Sauce</h3><P>A quick cream sauce made with flour, butter, milk and broth. 
            If you’d like to add cheese, remove the sauce from the heat and stir in a handful or two of shredded cheese. 
            It will melt from the heat of the sauce.</P></li>
        <li><h3>Seasonings</h3><p>Simple seasonings in this recipe include salt, pepper, onion, garlic. 
            Add in your own favorites including thyme, rosemary, parsley.</p></li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h4>Making scalloped potatoes from scratch takes time but it is easy. While true scalloped potatoes do not have cheese, we sometimes add a little bit in!</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Thinly slice potatoes & onions</b> - 
            <ul><li>Slice the potatoes evenly to ensure the scalloped potatoes cook evenly</li>
            <li>a mandolin makes this very easy</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Make homemade "roux" sauce:</b></li>
        <li>Layer potatoes, onions and sauce. Cover and bake.</li>
        <li>Remove foil and bake a bit more, this step creates the delicious brown top on the scalloped potatoes</li>
        <li>Let cool for 20 minutes for the sauce to thicken</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol><li>Preheat the Oven to 350</li></ol>
    <h3>Sauce</h3>
    <ol><li>To make the sauce, melt butter, onion and garlic over medium low heat. Cook until onion is softened, about 3 minutes. Add flour and cook for 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low. Combine milk and broth. Add a small amount at a time whisking to thicken. 
            The mixture will become very thick, continue adding a little bit of liquid at a time whisking until smooth.</li>
        <li>Once all of the liquid has been added, bring to a boil over medium heat while continuing to whisk.  Stir in salt and pepper and let boil 1 minute.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Assembly</h3>
    <ol><li>Grease a 9"x13" baking dish. Place ⅓ of the potatoes in the bottom and season with salt and pepper. Pour ⅓ of the cream sauce sauce over top.</li>
        <li>Repeat layers ending with cream sauce. Cover and bake for 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Uncover and bake for an additional 35-45 minutes or until golden brown and potatoes are tender. Broil for 3-4 minutes to obtain a golden top.</li>
        <li>Allow to rest for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
